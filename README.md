# Description

One of the assignments from one of the Scala courses (Functional Program Design in Scala) has you finish the implementation of a solver for a game called [Bloxorz](https://www.miniclip.com/games/bloxorz/en/).
I liked the program enough that I thought I will try to see if I can make a Sudoku solver out of it.
This is an adventure, as my knowledge of both Scala and functional programming can't be guaranteed.
